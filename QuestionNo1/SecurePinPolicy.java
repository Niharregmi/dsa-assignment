/* 
    The SecurePinPolicy program evaluates a given PIN code and calculates the minimum number of 
    changes needed to make it "strong" according to a set of security rules. A strong PIN must be
    between 6 and 20 characters long, include at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter,
    and one digit, and must not contain three or more repeating characters in a row. The program 
    first scans the PIN to identify which character types are missing and detects sequences
    of repeated characters that are three or more in length. If the PIN is shorter than 6 
    characters, the required changes are the maximum between the number of missing charactertypes and the number 
    of characters needed to reach length 6. For PINs with lengths between 6 and 20, 
    the program calculates the number of replacements needed to break up repeating sequences and ensures all 
    character types are present. If the PIN is longer than 20 characters, deletions are necessary, and the program 
    strategically deletes characters within repeating sequences to minimize the number of 
    replacements required. Finally, it returns the sum of deletions and the maximum of missing 
    character types or replacements to produce the minimal number of total changes required to make
    the PIN secure. The provided examples illustrate how the function handles different cases, 
    including short, moderate, and already strong PINs.
