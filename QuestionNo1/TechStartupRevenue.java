    /* The TechStartupRevenue program is designed to help a tech startup 
    maximize its capital by executing a limited number of profitable projects.
    Each project requires a certain investment and yields a specific revenue. The
    goal is to choose at most k projects that offer the highest possible return, given 
    the startup's current capital c. To solve this problem, the code first pairs each projectâ€™s investment 
    and revenue into Project objects and stores them in a list. This list is then sorted in ascending order 
    based on investment requirements, so that the cheapest projects come first. 
    The core logic uses a greedy strategy with a max-heap (priority queue), where
    for each of the k rounds, the algorithm pushes all projects that are affordable
    with the current capital into the heap. This heap allows quick access to the most profitable
    project that can currently be executed. The project with the highest revenue is selected and its
    revenue is added to the capital. This process repeats up to k times or until no further projects can be afforded. 
    Finally, the program returns the maximum capital achieved after the project executions. 
    The approach is efficient and ensures that at each step, the most profitable option within the
    current budget is selected to maximize overall gain. */
